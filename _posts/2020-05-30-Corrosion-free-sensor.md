I have used a "Corrosion Resistant Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor" lst year for my flower watering system. I have put them inside for the winter since I didn't need them in winter. Now I wanted to build the system up again, but the sensor is not working anymore.<!--more-->
Although the sensor itself seem to be corrosion resistant, the electronic is not. If stopped working maybe due to corrosion?

I tried to solder the joints to fix it, but It did not work. So rest i peace Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor.

But how could I make it more resistant to corrosion? I try acrylic paint:
